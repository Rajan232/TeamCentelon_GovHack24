# Executive Brief Creation using LLM: Documentation
 
## Problem Statement
 
**Objective:** The goal is to create a comprehensive and concise executive brief that summarizes key findings, insights, and actionable recommendations based on accident data. This brief aims to provide high-level decision-makers with a clear, impactful overview of road safety issues, thereby guiding policy decisions and safety initiatives.
 
**Context:** The need for such executive briefs arises from the complex and voluminous nature of road safety data. Government agencies and policymakers require distilled, actionable insights to effectively address road safety challenges, improve infrastructure, and enhance public safety measures.
 
## Solution Overview
 
**1. Data Processing and Insights Generation:**
 
- **Data Loading and Processing:** The code loads and processes accident data from CSV files, including accident records, locations, persons involved, and vehicles. It extracts key statistics such as the total number of accidents, average severity, fatal accident rates, and distributions of road types, injury levels, and vehicle types.
 
- **Insights Generation:** Based on the extracted statistics, the code generates actionable insights. These insights highlight patterns and critical findings, such as the frequency of accidents, common road types, and prevalent injury levels.
 
**2. Vector Store Creation:**
 
- **FAISS Vector Store:** The generated insights are converted into a vector store using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search). This vector store allows for efficient retrieval and querying of the insights.
 
**3. Prompt Engineering and LLM Integration:**
 
- **Prompt Template:** A prompt template is crafted to guide the LLM in generating the executive brief. The template includes sections for an overview of the road safety situation, key insights, actionable recommendations, and areas needing further investigation.
 
- **LLM Integration:** The AzureChatOpenAI LLM is utilized to process the prompt and generate the executive brief. The LLM is configured with specific deployment and model details, allowing it to provide contextually relevant and high-quality responses.
 
**4. Executive Brief Generation:**
 
- **RetrievalQA Chain:** The `RetrievalQA` chain uses the vector store to retrieve relevant insights and the LLM to generate a well-structured executive brief based on these insights.
 
## Role of LLM
 
**1. Contextual Understanding:** The LLM helps in interpreting complex data insights and framing them into a coherent narrative. It understands the nuances of the road safety data and provides contextually relevant information.
 
**2. Content Generation:** By utilizing the prompt template, the LLM generates a concise and actionable executive brief. It ensures that the brief is focused, clear, and adheres to the specified word limit, making it suitable for high-level decision-makers.
 
**3. Efficiency:** The LLM automates the creation of executive briefs, reducing the time and effort required to manually analyze data and generate reports. This efficiency is crucial for timely decision-making and policy formulation.
 
## Benefits for the Government
 
**1. Informed Decision-Making:** The executive briefs provide government agencies with a clear and actionable summary of road safety issues. This enables informed decision-making and prioritization of safety measures.
 
**2. Enhanced Policy Development:** By highlighting key insights and recommendations, the briefs support the development of targeted policies and initiatives aimed at improving road safety and reducing accidents.
 
**3. Resource Allocation:** The briefs help in identifying critical areas that need attention, allowing for more effective allocation of resources and implementation of safety measures.
 
**4. Public Awareness:** The insights and recommendations can be used to raise public awareness about road safety, potentially leading to changes in behavior and improved safety outcomes.
 
**5. Strategic Planning:** The automated and data-driven approach supports strategic planning and long-term road safety initiatives, contributing to overall public safety and infrastructure development.
